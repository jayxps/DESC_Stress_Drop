Hi Mr Peng,

I ve read my sac acc file into MatLab. The max/min values seem to be alright
but the time display is not right. Attached you will find an example.
The original Sac-file + the MatLab-file.
Could you tell me what went wrong? That would be awesome as I dont have anyone
helping me here with that problem.
Another question:
What is the normal procedure to do the FFT and look at the spectral domain
afterwards?

Thanks for your time in advance. Very much appreciated!!!
Best regards,
Flo Buech
